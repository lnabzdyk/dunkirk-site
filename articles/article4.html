                <h3>'Looking positively delighted about being bombed by Nazis!' One smirking extra accused of 'ruining' the trailer for WWII film Dunkirk
                </h3>

                <p>Eagle-eyed viewers noticed something quite peculiar during the first trailer for Christopher Nolan's highly-anticipated Dunkirk.</p>

                <p>One extra among a sea of 1,500 supporting artists broke character as he was spotted smirking while the rest recoiled in fear at the sound of incoming German bombers flying above them in the 56-second-long preview.
                Film fans took to Twitter following the debut of the trailer last Thursday to discuss the extra's light-hearted reaction to the approaching bombers.</p>

                <p>The particular scene which was shot in dull tones and focused on the bleak, raw nature of the 1940s French coastline- the exact spots where 76 years ago 338,000 British, French and Belgian troops were evacuated in Operation Dynamo.
                'Dunkirk extra looking positively delighted about the prospect of being bombed by Nazis,' @ChristophHooton noted on Twitter.</p>

                <p>And he wasn't the only one as @MKsongbird revealed: 'Now my eyes gravitate to that not so "in the moment" extra in the Dunkirk teaser every single time.'@SAlienxandra offered his opinion, simply stating: 'Dunkirk Trailer - Best Extra Fail Ever', while @GrogsMovieBlogs seemed fed up: 'Stop saying the #Dunkirk teaser is amazing. Nothing happens in it except for a really bad extra being a really bad extra'.Despite the unfortunate facial expression from the extra, the score proved to be tense as it reached the climax of the troops grouped together.</p>

                <p>None of the film's star names feature in the trailer, with the eerie landscape all that's required to portray the desperate nature of the situation. The footage is interspersed with dramatic text reading, 'At the point of crisis. At the point of annihilation. Survival is victory.' At one point a lone soldier can be seen trudging towards the crashing surf, while another shot shows rows of dead bodies partially covered by sand. The vast scale of the project has been nothing short of breathtaking with 1,500 extras lined up on the beaches of Dunkirk, in the exact spots where 76 years ago 338,000 British, French and Belgian troops were evacuated in Operation Dynamo.</p>

                <p>Director Nolan assembled his men alongside cardboard cut-outs to bolster the number of troops for the dramatic scenes.
                The acclaimed director, who boasts the likes of The Dark Knight trilogy, Inception and Interstellar on his resume, has paid astonishing attention to detail while filming the project. He drafted in a fleet of vehicles, which included a Spitfire and a French T-47 Class Destroyer, Maillé-Brézé, for an authentic reproduction rather than relying on CGI.</p>

                <p>Alongside the ship, which has been anchored near the beach since filming commenced, Supermarine Spitfire - the RAF's famed single-seater fighter of the period - have been put through their paces in aerial shots. The film features Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Sir Kenneth Branagh and Mark Rylance as well as One Direction star Harry Styles in his move debut.
                Slash Film reported that the big names in the cast are taking on the film’s supporting roles, with the young newcomers - like Styles - taking centre stage. Dunkirk opens in 1940 with hundreds of thousands of British and Allied troops hemmed in by the German army on the beaches of northern France.</p>

                <p>The British launched Operation Dynamo to save them between May 7 and June 4; 338,000 arrived safely in England. Among the fleet were hundreds of privately owned boats – popularly known as the ‘little ships’.</p>

                <p>Nolan’s film is the first recreation of the evacuation since the 1958 original starring John Mills, Richard Attenborough and Robert Urquhart. It is slated for release in July 2017 with filming having taken place in Holland as well as the UK and Los Angeles.</p>
