                <h3>Christopher Nolan’s &lsquo;Dunkirk&rsquo; Teaser Overwhelms Rival Trailers on Twitter
                </h3>

                <p>It clocks in at just 66 seconds, and much of that time is taken up by text, but the teaser for director Christopher Nolan‘s upcoming “Dunkirk” offers just enough of a taste of the World War II story’s epic scale to pique moviegoers’ interest.</p>

                <p>The spot’s tantalizing vibe helped it dominate the conversation on social media last week, as it topped all other new trailers on Twitter by a large margin, according to data analytics firm ListenFirst Media.</p>

                <p>“Dunkirk,” which hits theaters July 21 next year, was already one of the most anticipated movies of 2017. It boasts big names in its cast — Tom Hardy, Kenneth Branagh, Mark Rylance and Harry Styles of the pop group One Direction — and parts of the film will be shot using Imax cameras.</p>

                <p>It also marks the first time that Nolan, known for high-concept epics such as his “Dark Knight” trilogy and “Inception,” is tackling a true story. “Dunkirk” is inspired by the so-called “Miracle at Dunkirk,” a massive evacuation of more than 300,000 British, French and Belgian servicemembers in May and June of 1940 from Dunkirk in France. The central image of the teaser depicts troops stranded on a causeway as an offscreen warplane bears down on them.</p>

                <p>Rounding out the rest of the top 5 last week are the trailers for animated comedy “Storks,” teen romp “Laid in America,” coming-of-age ensemble film “XOXO” and Jerry Lewis vehicle “Max Rose.”</p>
