            <p>Dunkirk is an upcoming British epic action-thriller film written, co-produced and directed by Christopher Nolan. The story is set in World War II and centres around the Dunkirk evacuation.</p>

            <p>Filming began on 23 May 2016 in Dunkirk, France and was shot on IMAX 65 mm and 65 mm large format film stock by cinematographer Hoyte van Hoytema. Hoytema previously collaborated with director Christopher Nolan on his 2014 film Interstellar.</p>

            <p>Tom Hardy, Kenneth Branagh and Mark Rylance were in talks to join the ensemble as supporting characters in late 2015. Fionn Whitehead was cast as the lead in March 2016 and Jack Lowden, Aneurin Barnard and Harry Styles were added to the list shortly after. Cillian Murphy joined the following month.James D'Arcy, Barry Keoghan and Tom Glynn-Carney were included in the line-up later that May.</p>

            <p>Principal photography commenced on 23 May 2016 in Dunkirk, France; in the months following, production proceeded in Urk, Netherlands, Swanage and Weymouth in Dorset, United Kingdom and at the Point Vicente Interpretive Center and Lighthouse in Rancho Palos Verdes, United States. Filming in Dunkirk took place in the same location as the real historical evacuation. In the course of shooting, Dunkirk operated under the codename "Bodega Bay". The film was shot on a combination of IMAX 65 mm and 65 mm large format film stock. Nolan reconditioned actual warships for the shoot, including the French Navy destroyer Maillé-Brézé, and reportedly spent US$5 million of the budget on a vintage aircraft so as to attach it with IMAX cameras before crashing it on-screen. Avoiding the use of computer-generated imagery, the production employed cardboard cut-out props of soldiers and military vehicles to create the illusion of a large army.</p>

            <p>By January 2016, composer Hans Zimmer had already begun working on the score.</p>

            <p>In September 2015, Warner Bros. announced Dunkirk and set the film for a 21 July 2017 theatrical release, after which it will be projected on IMAX, 70 mm and 35 mm film. The announcement trailer debuted in theatres ahead of the superhero film Suicide Squad and was released online on 4 August 2016. According to data analytics firm ListenFirst Media, it generated the most Twitter engagement of all the trailers that were released that week.</p>
